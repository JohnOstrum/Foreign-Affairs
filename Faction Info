Spartans
Robotic soldiers hellbent on war and annihilation. No one knows who created them or why. They crush any sign of life, from the greatest giant to the smallest microbe. This faction focuses on armor, and is weak in terms of long-range weapons.


Phoraxol
An alien race that fight and crush any race that could possibly pose a threat to Phoraxol society. Theyâ€™re very hypocritical, paranoid, and headstrong, posing serious threats to others. They tend to be fast and offensive, carrying rapid-fire weaponry, but have negligible armor


Terrans
The refugees from Earth after it was destroyed by the Sun. The Terrans tend to be very endurant, steadfast, and vicious, if a bit loose in the head. Terrans focus on melee and armor, and are few in numbers. They tend to fall under artillery.
