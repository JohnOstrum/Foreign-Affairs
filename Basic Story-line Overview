Basic Info
Foreign Affairs is an RTS set in the year 7000. 
Earth has been destroyed by alien races that decided to duke it out on earth.
The races want Teraznium, a rare mineral necessary for warp travel. The galaxy is running low on Teraznium, so it's worth killing over.
Some races are more friendly towards others, while others are more agressive.
